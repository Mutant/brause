brause
======

a non validating EPP test client with minimal dependencies. it is
designed to test the NZRS .nz EPP implementation but can easily be
customised to test other EPP implementations as well or even act as a
command line interface to EPP registries (even though performance is not
the goal here)

EPP XML templates are as templates in the template tree and can be run
with the _brause_ commandline utility.
