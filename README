brause
======

a non validating EPP test client with minimal dependencies. it is
designed to test the NZRS .nz EPP implementation but can easily be
customised to test other EPP implementations as well or even act as a
command line interface to EPP registries (even though performance is not
the goal here)

EPP XML templates are as templates in the template tree and can be run
with the _brause_ commandline utility.

The commandline utility reads commands and options off a config file
(standard is recipies.conf) which can be defined with the -d commandline
switch. The config file format holds the entire command sequence that
should be tested in the following way:

<step>
    command = login
    user = XXX
    pass = XXXXXXXXXXX
</step>
<step>
    command = DO YOUR TESTS HERE
    key     = value
    <nested>
        key = value
    </nested>
</step>
<step>
    command = logout
</step>

This way command sequences can be tested quite easy. This should work
for stress testing servers as well.
